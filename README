CachePC
=======

This repository contains proof-of-concept code for a cache side-channel
attack on AMD SEV-SNP dubbed PRIME+COUNT. It extends the traditional PRIME+PROBE
by using performance counters for accurate cache line eviction detection.
We demonstrate that it can be used observe what addresses are accessed by a
guest and use that information to infer what cryptographic secrets are used.


tests
-----

Several test-cases were used to verify parts of the exploit chain separately:

test/eviction:
	Demonstrate that performance counters & our setup are accurate enough
	to detect a single eviction in L1 cache and infer its cache set
	through PRIME+COUNT

test/kvm-eviction:
	Demonstrate that the cache set of a memory access instruction can be
	inferred in non-SEV / SEV / SEV-ES / SEV-SNP -enabled vms respectively.

test/kvm-step:
	Demonstrate that SEV-SNP enabled vms can be single-stepped using local
	APIC timers to interrupt the guest and increment the interrupt interval
	while observing the RIP+RFLAGS ciphertext in the VMSA for changes to
	detect that a single instruction has been executed.

test/kvm-pagestep:
	Demonstrate that a SEV-SNP enabled vm can be quickly single-stepped
	and analyzed by tracking a single page at a time. This type
	of tracking creates a page-wise profile of the guests execution,
	which can be used to infer what the guest is doing and to begin
	fine-grained single-stepping.

test/qemu-pagestep:
	Replicate result from kvm-pagestep on a qemu-based vm running debian.

test/qemu-eviction:
	Replicate result from kvm-eviction on a qemu-based vm running debian
	using a specially crafted guest program to signal when measurement
	should take place to infer the accessed set.

test/qemu-aes:
	Demonstrate that AES encryption keys can be leaked from a
	modified qemu-based linux guest.

test/qemu-poc:
	Demonstrate that AES encryption keys can be leaked from an
	unmodified qemu-based linux guest.


modes
-----

The kernel module employs a few different modes of tracking described
in more detail below:

CPC_TRACK_FAULT_NO_RUN:
	Tracks access to all guest pages and lets the guest page fault over and over
	without untracking / handling any page faults. This results in a decent
	baseline measurement when we dont want to step the vm.

CPC_TRACK_EXIT_EVICTION:
	Set apic timer such that for any reasonably short KVM_RUN no local apic
	interrupts will occur to cause exits. Good for collecting PRIME+COUNT
	measurements over a clean run to a guest-invoked exit such as KVM_EXIT_HLT.

CPC_TRACK_PAGES:
	Track execution of all guest pages. While the guest is running untrack
	a single executable page at a time based on page-faults. Allows tracking
	which guest pages are executed and how long using retired instructions.

CPC_TRACK_STEPS:
	Single-step guest exection. For each step, collect either only instruction
	or instruction and page-faults. Allows tracking not only which sets were
	evicted but what gfns were involved in the access. A target page can
	be set, such that we will first page-step until the page is reached,
	then single-step while running instructions on that page.


setup
-----

Testing was done on a Supermicro H12SSL-i V1.01 motherboard and AMD EPYC 72F3
(Family 0x19, Model 0x01) cpu. The motherboard bios version is 2.4 and was
released 2022-04-14.


The host kernel and qemu were built using the AMDESE/AMDSEV repo on branch
sev-snp-devel at commmit a480a51. Install the host kernel by running:

# ./bulid.sh --package
# cd snp-release-`date "+%Y-%m-%d"`
# ./install.sh


For the build to complete the following packages needed to be installed
following a clean install of debian linux-5.10.0-21:

git build-essential flex dpkg bc rsync libelf-dev libssl-dev bison ninja-build
    pkg-config libglib2.0-dev libpixman-1-dev python3 coda nasm uuid-dev iasl


The following non-default BIOS settings were used:

Advanced > CPU Configuration > Local APIC Mode = xAPIC
Advanced > CPU Configuration > SMT Control = Disabled
Advanced > CPU Configuration > Core Performance Boost = Disabled
Advanced > CPU Configuration > Global C-state Control = Disabled
Advanced > CPU Configuration > L1 Stream HW Prefetcher = Disabled
Advanced > CPU Configuration > L2 Stream HW Prefetcher = Disabled
Advanced > CPU Configuration > SMEE = Enabled
Advanced > CPU Configuration > SEV ASID Count = 509
Advanced > CPU Configuration > SEV ASID Space Limit Control = Manual
Advanced > CPU Configuration > SEV ASID Space Limit = 110
Advanced > CPU Configuration > SNP Memory (RMP Table) Coverage = Enabled
Advanced > CPU Configuration > SVM Mode = Enabled
Advanced > North Bridge Configuration > SEV-SNP Support = Enabled
Advanced > North Bridge Configuration > Memory Configuration > TSME = Disabled


The following host kernel parameters were used:

kvm_amd.sev=1 kvm_amd.sev_es=1 nokaslr nosplash debug systemd.log_level=debug
    isolcpus=2,10,3,11 nohz_full=2,10,3,11 rcu_nocbs=2,10,3,11 nmi_watchdog=0
    transparent_hugepage=never apic lapic panic=-1 preempt=none


To successfully build and load the kvm.ko and kvm-amd.ko modules after building
cachepc, ensure that the full kernel was built atleast once beforehand by running:

$ cp $(AMDSEV_REPO)/linux/host/.config linux/.config 
$ make linux


In case SEV-SNP initialization fails due to a low firmware version, the
firmware can be updated to v1.51 by running:

# cp extra/amd_sev_fam19h_model0xh_1.51.03.sbin /lib/firmware/amd/amd_sev_fam19h_model0xh.sbin
# rmmod ccp
# sudo insmod /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp.ko dyndbg="+p"


Note, the checked out commit of the modified kernel (previously the kernel
patch file) may be incorrect for revisions older than 864f5fa9d539.
