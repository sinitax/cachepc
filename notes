Observations:

Questions:
- test/sevstep: why 0 then 15, arent both accesses in the first page?
	=> first code page and stack access
- test/sevstep: why does it seem to work with event race but not without?
	=> it doesnt (anymore)

Tried:
- try invalidating tlbs (no effect, prob was already)

Next steps:
- enable single-steping with multiple page faults (only one ends up in
  last_fault_gfn and others stay untracked)
- try adjusting timer for single stepping
- Try to setup the non-baseline step without apic, but remapping page
  such that we see the relevant page faults and the gfn increment
- test/sevstep: implement counter.. read program memory to see
  how many instructions were executed on apic timer
- add warning for high values in baseline

Meeting questions:
- Why is decrypted rip sometimes off-by-one?
	=> 
- VM gets interrupted independent of our APIC (by the scheduler) is this a problem?
	=>
-
